The 8 ball game is an entertainment website. 
It is there as a passtime game to ask a yes or no question and receive a yes or no answer.


# Features
1. It has a weclome section.
2. An input name section.
3. And lastly the game section.

The welcome section gives insturctions in case someone is unfamiliar with the Magic 8 ball game.
Then once the user presses the next button the site asks for the user name. This will serve to personalise
the game for a more warm experience.
Lastly, the game secion gives cute sassy answers by referencing the user name.
It serves the purpose of entertainment.

# Testing
No testing has been done yet.

# Bugs
There were several bugs.
One the user did not have to initialy write a question. If the ask button was clicked answers were provided without a qustion input.
The other bug was encounterd when i was trying to hide the sections so that it would move swiftly along to the next section i.e. from welcome to name to game sections. The next button was not working. The issue was I had named the container the same instead of the next container name so that it would move to the next section.
